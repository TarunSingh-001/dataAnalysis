Data analysis Using Python
For this task, I worked on a small project where I used Python to read and analyze a sales CSV file. It had details like the date, product name, region, and how much was sold.
I used a library called Pandas to:
Load the CSV file into Python
Group the sales by region
Add up the total sales for each region
Print the results and also show a simple bar chart
This helped me see which region sold the most. I didn’t use any fancy tools — just basic Python and simple logic. It felt good to learn how we can get useful info from a file so easily
